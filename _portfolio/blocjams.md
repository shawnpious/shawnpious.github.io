# Summary
-


## Explanation

A combination of html, css, javascript, and jQuery was a neccesity when programming bloc jams. We must take a walk in the users shoes to really understand how and what we need to change for modern and attractive UI. So after thorough research we came of with the simplistic and functional bloc jams. There are 3 main pages for Bloc Jams; we have the fist page that shows the logo and consists of two navigational links that will take you back to the home screen or it will take you to the list of albums bloc jams has stored. If you are in the albums page, you can click on any album image and it will take you to another page which will show all the song in that album as well as a player bar as a fixed footer. To the left of each song name is a Play button icon when clicked it will play the current song. 

## Problem

My ultimate goal is to become a web developer and I know it's not going to happen overnight, Bloc Jams was my first project and it taught me a lot of my strengths and weaknesses. The biggest problem I had was because of my experience with coding, I was just learning and this is the first time I was really challenged to apply everything I learned. I had to apply all the skills I learned and on top of that I also learned some new ones during the developing process. The biggest problem that I faced when programming bloc jams was the player bar and play/pause buttons on each of the currrently playing songs. I used the Buzz Library API to create the player bar functionality, also I created multiple javascript functions to track user mouse actions. Moreover, at this point I hadn't learned angular, but my next objective is to recreate bloc jams using Angular. Continuing, I used the javascript functions to track and play the music, but I noticed that my code wasn't "DRY". 

## Solution

I learned the difficult way that coding takes time to learn and I was dealing with using both Windows and Mac for this project because my screen cracked on my retina macbook pro, but I got it fixed thank god! This caused more difficulty for me because the controls are different on both platforms and the PC made my eyes hurt. Luckily bloc jams was well guided and I had my mentor right aside me helping me make sure I was on the right path.  

## Results

The more practice I get and the more I consistently improve my coding skills. The more I code the easier it is to understand the language. Even though I'm still learning new things everyday I still see how far I've come from day 1. The more I test and improve my code the more confident I am. Bloc Jams helped me break the ice into building bigger and more complex projects.

## Conclusion

To wrap this up, Bloc Jams turned out pretty awesome! I was amazed on how it was put together. This was my first time dealing with so many functions and variables at the same time it got very overwhelming. I believe once I start my own project and create my own classes, Ids, Variable, etc. It will be much easier to track,nmaintain, and understand the code.
