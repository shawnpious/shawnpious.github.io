title: My Experience at Bloc
---

Welcome to the Bloc Party! Being a student at bloc has changed my perspective on education. I did my research and compared all the other coding camps out there, but Bloc attracted me the most. Bloc stood out for me mainly on their "apprenticeship" style structure for students. Before I started my Web Developer track I got to choose my own mentor that I would meet with twice a week. I've tried teaching myself to code for a long time, I've done almost all the free lectures on Codecademy, Codeschool,  and some FCC lectures and it was quite simple because all the site held your hand through each lecture and you knew if the code wwas right or wrong. Unfortunately, when you code on an editor like atom or brackets you don't have something telling you if your incorrect because you choose the code and customize it to your preference. st of the times my code isn't functioning it's because I missed place something and I spend hours trying to find it till my brain and eyes are just burnt out. This is where having a mentor is beneficial, my mentor Rajeev Signh can spot out any mistakes or erros I made in matter of seconds and gets me back on track. Most of the time he guides me in the direction and I find it myself and it's usually thw most simple line of code im missing. This really helps me not draing myself and keep coding and progressing.
