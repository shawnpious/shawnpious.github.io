title: My Biggest Challenges
---

“Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter.”
- Eric S. Raymond

Some of the biggest challenges I faced during this journey was firstly time management, coding became a part of my life a big part actually. I spend hours on end coding and watching videos and I also go to many networking events and surround myself with people of the programming world. Also, I've had many times where I just felt stuck and would be close to giving up, sometimes you have to walk away from the computer in order to see the answer. I've even had dreams about code and figured asnwers in my sleep. Luckily, since I have a mentor I meet with weekly it's easier to get unstuck. I would fry my brain just looking for that semi-colon or equals sign. The truth is that their is always an answer and if you look you will find it and figure it out. I found that having confidence in your code really does help, and the console on the developer tools on google chrome is my best friend.
